<h1>Course Project: Workout Builder</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project developed a Java program that aids personal trainers in creating exercise programs. I organized exercises into warm-ups, main exercises, and cool-downs using a singly-linked list. Users can add new exercises to specific sections of the workout and remove exercises as needed. The project also includes extensive automated testing and grading criteria, ensuring correctness and adherence to programming standards.

--- Exercise.java and demo() in WorkoutBuilderTester are provided by professor to help compile and troubleshoot the program implementation.
